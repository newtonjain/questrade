# Contact List Application

A simple contact list application that lets the user render a beautifully generated contact list with incremental search feature and the ability to add, modify or delete any contact.

The application has 2 main tabs. The existing list of contacts is rendered under the Contacts tab and a New Contact Form is rendered under the Add tab. 

This project is generated with [yo angular generator]. 


## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview that will start a connect web server on http://localhost:9000.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

sudo npm install -g
bower install
